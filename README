the most important thing in this assignment is that we use a hashMap that acts
as a database for our users: this hashmap includes pairs such as (identifier, user).
An identifier is any string that can be associated to that user: email, Iban,
cardNumber, alias. I used this mechanism for ease of access to specific users.


in this assignment two design patterns were used:
    Factory pattern:
        there is a factory class specialized for instantiating commands
        based on an input string. These commands are then added to a Command list:
            Command is the superclass for all commands.

        this pattern could have been used for the transaction classes also, but
        i will do that in the second part


    Command pattern:
        the commands that are instantiated using the factory class are added
        to a list in the invoker class. This class is responsible to calling
        the execute method from each class and handling the thrown exceptions
        from these methods (exception types will later be expanded, since now there
        is currently only one type)


    ExchangeRateGraph:
        this is a class that takes the input exchange rates and puts them in a
        directed weighted graph. This is done to then make it easy to convert from
        any currency to another by finding a path from one node to another
        (accounting for exchange rates) using the dfs algorithm. In the graph
        implementation, the convRate is BigDecimal type in order to ensure
        there is no floating pointer error

    Account:
        each account holds its associated cards and transactions
        SavingsAccount is a subclass of account that interacts with interest.

    OneTimeCard:
        a subclass of card that overwrites the useCard method that deletes the
        current card and creates a new one (since the one time card can t be used
        twice). In the Card class this method just makes the payment

    debugCommands:
        PrintTransactions:
            we get the user and pull the transactions from every account and then
            sort them by their timestamp.
        PrintUsers:
            we take all the users from the User HashMap, put them in a set and then
            sort them by the time they were added in the database

    reportCommands:
        Report:
            gets all the transactions in a given time period for a specific account
        SpendingReport:
            gets all transactions that classify as spending ones (currently just
            online payments classify as that). Then by each commerciant they are
            compressed into how much the account has spent at that certain place

    TransactionCommands:
        commands that classify as transactions and have a matching Transaction class

    transactions package:
        contains helper classes matching their respective commands. This makes
        adding transactions easy to the transaction list in the accounts because
        we could have considered the commands themselves to be the transactions, but
        that would require a lot of JsonIgnores and would also make the code less
        flexible and readable.

        If later on we consider another class to be a transaction, doing that would
        be very easy.
